# Little Ants - MastroCaleb

Little Ants is a mod that aims at adding ants to the game, the goal is to achive the most Vanilla-like experience possible.

## Setup for other modders

For now there is a really basic third party implementation, but im working on a better one.

(Do not worry, this method of adding ant food will still work after the new one is released)

The only thing that you have to do is add your block to one of the Block Tags that are contained in "#ants:food/ant_food.json":

(Please, use one of these and DO NOT add your blocks directly to this tag)

### Vanilla Tags - Only food (no leaf)

"#minecraft:leaves": If your block is in this tag: Ants will obtain the leaf from the block, without showing anything in their mouth.
"#minecraft:saplings": If your block is in this tag: Ants will obtain the leaf from the block, without showing anything in their mouth.

### Vanilla Tags - Vanilla Leaves

If for some reason you want to use a vanilla leaf for your block, add it to one of these:

"#ants:food/vanilla/acacia_leaf_food": Ants will have the Acacia Leaf in their mouth.

"#ants:food/vanilla/azalea_leaf_food": Ants will have the Azalea Leaf in their mouth.

"#ants:food/vanilla/birch_leaf_food": Ants will have the Birch Leaf in their mouth.

"#ants:food/vanilla/dark_oak_leaf_food": Ants will have the Dark Oak Leaf in their mouth.

"#ants:food/vanilla/flowering_azalea_leaf_food": Ants will have the Flowring Azalea Leaf in their mouth.

"#ants:food/vanilla/jungle_leaf_food": Ants will have the Jungle Leaf in their mouth.

"#ants:food/vanilla/oak_leaf_food": Ants will have the Oak Leaf in their mouth.

"#ants:food/vanilla/spruce_leaf_food": Ants will have the Spruce Leaf in their mouth.
